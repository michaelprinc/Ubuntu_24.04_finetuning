# Ubuntu GUI Troubleshooting Guide for Windows Users

Common issues Windows users face when switching to Ubuntu and their solutions.

## üñ•Ô∏è Desktop & Interface Issues

### "I can't create desktop icons / Pin to Desktop is missing"

**Problem**: Ubuntu GNOME doesn't show desktop icons by default, and there's no "Pin to Desktop" option in right-click menus.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Method 1: Install Desktop Icons NG extension
./gui-customization/setup_windows_like_gui.sh desktop

# Method 2: Use our desktop icon creator script
./gui-customization/create_desktop_icon.sh "Firefox"
./gui-customization/create_desktop_icon.sh common  # Creates common icons

# Method 3: Manual creation
cp /usr/share/applications/firefox.desktop ~/Desktop/
chmod +x ~/Desktop/firefox.desktop
gio set ~/Desktop/firefox.desktop metadata::trusted true
```

**Alternative**: Use the dock/taskbar - right-click on running apps and select "Add to Favorites"

### "Extension installation fails with 404 errors"

**Problem**: GNOME extension download URLs return 404 Not Found errors.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Use our improved extension installer
./gui-customization/install_gnome_extensions.sh

# Or install Extension Manager and use GUI
sudo apt install gnome-shell-extension-manager
# Then open "Extensions" app and browse/install extensions

# Alternative: Install via Flatpak
flatpak install flathub com.mattjakeman.ExtensionManager

# Manual installation via browser:
# 1. Open Firefox/Chrome
# 2. Go to https://extensions.gnome.org
# 3. Install browser extension when prompted
# 4. Search and install: Dash to Panel, ArcMenu, Desktop Icons NG
```

**Root Cause**: GNOME extensions website changed their download URLs and version compatibility system. Our script now uses multiple installation methods as fallbacks.

### "Extensions don't work after installation"

**Problem**: Extensions are installed but don't appear or function.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Check if extensions are installed
gnome-extensions list

# Enable extensions manually
gnome-extensions enable dash-to-panel@jderose9.github.com
gnome-extensions enable arcmenu@arcmenu.com
gnome-extensions enable ding@rastersoft.com

# Check GNOME version compatibility
gnome-shell --version

# Restart GNOME Shell (X11 only - doesn't work on Wayland)
Alt + F2, type 'r', press Enter

# For Wayland, log out and back in
```

### "Where is the Start Menu?"

**Problem**: Ubuntu uses Activities overview instead of a traditional Start menu.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install ArcMenu extension for Windows-like start menu
./gui-customization/setup_windows_like_gui.sh taskbar

# Or use existing interface:
# - Press Super key (Windows key)
# - Type application name
# - Press Enter
```

**Pro Tip**: The Super key + typing is often faster than navigating through menus!

### "The taskbar is on the side, not bottom"

**Problem**: Ubuntu's dock is on the left by default.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install Dash to Panel for bottom taskbar
./gui-customization/setup_windows_like_gui.sh taskbar

# Or move existing dock to bottom:
gsettings set org.gnome.shell.extensions.dash-to-dock dock-position BOTTOM
```

## ü™ü Window Management Issues

### "I can't resize windows by dragging edges"

**Problem**: Window edges might be too thin or you're not dragging from the right spot.

**Solutions**:
- Drag from the very edge of the window (1-2 pixels)
- Hold `Super` key + right-click anywhere on window to resize
- Use keyboard: `Alt + F8` then arrow keys
- Double-click window title bar to maximize/restore

### "Windows don't snap properly"

**Problem**: Window snapping behaves differently than Windows 11.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Ensure snapping is enabled
gsettings set org.gnome.mutter edge-tiling true

# Use keyboard shortcuts:
# Super + Left/Right for half-screen
# Super + Left then Super + Up for quarter-screen
```

### "Alt + Tab doesn't work the same"

**Problem**: Alt + Tab behavior differs from Windows.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Make Alt+Tab switch between windows (not applications)
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-windows "['<Alt>Tab']"
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.wm.keybindings switch-applications "['<Super>Tab']"
```

## üìÅ File Management Issues

### "I can't access Windows drives"

**Problem**: Windows NTFS drives might not mount automatically.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install NTFS support
sudo apt install ntfs-3g

# Mount Windows drive manually
sudo mkdir -p /mnt/windows
sudo mount -t ntfs-3g /dev/sdX1 /mnt/windows  # Replace sdX1 with your drive

# Auto-mount on startup - add to /etc/fstab:
echo "/dev/sdX1 /mnt/windows ntfs-3g defaults,uid=1000,gid=1000 0 0" | sudo tee -a /etc/fstab
```

### "File manager is too simple"

**Problem**: Default Files app lacks features compared to Windows Explorer.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install more feature-rich file managers
sudo apt install nemo thunar dolphin

# Set Nemo as default (most Windows-like)
./gui-customization/setup_windows_like_gui.sh

# Or manually:
xdg-mime default nemo.desktop inode/directory
```

### "Where are hidden files?"

**Problem**: Hidden files/folders are not visible by default.

**Solutions**:
- Press `Ctrl + H` in file manager to toggle hidden files
- Or: View menu ‚Üí Show Hidden Files
- Or permanently: Edit ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Views ‚Üí Show hidden files

## üé® Appearance Issues

### "Ubuntu looks nothing like Windows"

**Problem**: Default Ubuntu theme is very different from Windows 11.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install Windows 11-like theme
./gui-customization/setup_windows_like_gui.sh theme

# Or install manually:
# WhiteSur theme (Windows-like clean look)
# Fluent icons (Windows 11-style icons)
# Configure in GNOME Tweaks
```

### "Fonts look different/bad"

**Problem**: Font rendering differs from Windows.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Install Windows fonts
sudo apt install ttf-mscorefonts-installer

# Install additional font packages
sudo apt install fonts-liberation fonts-liberation2

# Configure font rendering
gsettings set org.gnome.desktop.interface font-name 'Segoe UI 11'
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è System Settings Issues

### "I can't find Control Panel"

**Problem**: Ubuntu uses Settings app instead of Control Panel.

**Solutions**:
- Press `Super + I` to open Settings
- Or: Click user menu (top right) ‚Üí Settings
- For advanced settings: Install `gnome-tweaks` and `dconf-editor`

### "Where is Device Manager?"

**Problem**: Ubuntu doesn't have a direct equivalent to Device Manager.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# Hardware information
sudo lshw -short
lsusb        # USB devices
lspci        # PCI devices
lscpu        # CPU info

# GUI alternative
sudo apt install hardinfo
hardinfo     # Graphical hardware info
```

### "How do I install/uninstall software?"

**Problem**: No Add/Remove Programs like Windows.

**Solutions**:
```bash
# GUI method - Ubuntu Software Center
gnome-software

# GUI method - Synaptic (advanced)
sudo apt install synaptic

# Command line (fastest)
sudo apt install package-name    # Install
sudo apt remove package-name     # Uninstall

   # Search for similar problems
   apt search problem-keyword
   ```

3. **Try the terminal**:
   ```bash
   # Run the application from terminal to see errors
   application-name
   ```

4. **Restart the service**:
   ```bash
